This is my CS50 final project. I try coding an android app in which you can see how much money you spent. This application will be coded in Kotlin using mostly the Android Studio IDE.
</br>
<h1>What this Application should provide</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The possibility to create an account and log in (delete account as well)</li>
  <li>Being able to type in the amount of money spent and selecting time frame (by default current time)</li>
  <li>Selecting a category for what the money was spent on</li>
  <li>Being able to plot a graph of money psent by time (velocity) and total amount of money spent ordered by week, month and year of selected category (food, electronics, event, diverse, all)</li>
</ul>
